      "We had initially sent requests to each other, and Heena declined my request because her bucket list already had many people. However, unknowingly, she rejected it, and that's how our slow communication began. It took around 1 to 2 weeks of regular chatting before we started having calls. I am grateful for this website and Mr. Mittal for creating this platform. I genuinely love this site. Thank you",
